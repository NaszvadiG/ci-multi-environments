# CodeIgniter Multiple Development Environments
### This multiple development environments module allows you to run your CodeIgniter (CI) install across multiple environments without the need to modify configurations each time you want to test. Built by [@jedkirby](http://twitter.com/jedkirby).

The multiple environmet modules works buy giving you an option to use prefixed or suffixed urls to determine the environment [System and Application] settings to be used. That enables you to have an unlimited amount of configurations depending on your situation.


## Basic Usage
This file will enable you to use multiple domain names for different environments, e.g. local / staging / live.
You're able to choose between using prefixed or suffixed urls, e.g:
 - local.site.com / site.local
 - stage.site.com / site.stage
